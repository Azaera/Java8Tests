# Java 8 Tests

# Version 1.0

This is a a small example with Lambdas and new operators with the new Java 8 features.
As time goes on, I will add in new functions.
So far it is written with an old basic MVC pattern but hopefully I can write it better at a
later stage. 
This is just for personal references as I still are at a course learning Java and wanting to experiment  with the new features.

Everything is written in [Eclipse Mars](https://projects.eclipse.org/releases/mars).
